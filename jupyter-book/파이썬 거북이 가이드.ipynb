    "In summary, this is what the code is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Line 1 sets up a for loop with a range from 1 to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lines 2 through 7 check if either player has reached their goal. If one of them has, then the program prints out the corresponding statement and breaks the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Line 8 moves the program on to the next set of steps if neither player has won.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Line 9 prints out a statement asking player one to press the Enter key to roll the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Line 10 takes a random value from the list die and stores it in die_outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Line 11 prints a statement prior to displaying the outcome of the dice roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Line 12 prints the dice outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Line 14 multiplies this value by 20 to reduce the overall number of steps required to complete the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Line 15 moves player one's `turtle` forward by this number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Lines 16 to 22 repeat these steps for player two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire for loop is repeated until one of the player's `turtle`s reaches the final position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can customize the game however you want, so go ahead and play around with it! You can add more `turtle`s, change the colors, change the speed, or even create some obstacles to challenge your players. It's all up to you as the developer of the game!"
